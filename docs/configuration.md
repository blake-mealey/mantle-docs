# Configuration

By default, Rocat looks for a project's configuration in a `rocat.yml` file but you can optionally
point Rocat to any YAML file.

## Reference

The configuration file contains the fields:

- `deployments`: An array of [`Deployment`](#deployment) objects.
  - **Required**
- `templates`: A [`Templates`](#templates) object.
  - **Required**
- `state`: A [`State`](#state). Defaults to `"local"`.

### Deployment

A deployment contains the fields:

- `name`: The name of the deployment. Must be unique across all deployments.
  - **Required**
- `branches`: An array of file globs to match against Git branches. If the `--deployment` option is
  not specified, this is how Rocat determines which deployment to use.
- `experienceId`: The ID of a Roblox experience to deploy to. If not provided, Rocat will create a
  new experience.
- `placeIds`: A dictionary of place names to IDs of Roblox places to deploy to. Note that the name
  should match an entry in the `places` field of the [`Templates`](#templates) object. If an ID is
  not provided, Rocat will create a new place.
- `tagCommit`: A boolean indicating whether or not to tag the commit with place file versions after
  successful deployments. It is recommended to only enable this on production deployment
  configurations.
- `overrides`: A [`Templates`](#templates) object. Any supplied fields will override the value
  specified in the [top-level](#reference) `templates` field.

```yml title="Example"
deployments:
  - name: staging
    branches: [dev, dev/*]

    enableStudioAccessToApis: true

      - marketing/game-thumbnail-default.png
```

In order to configure the name and description of an experience, use the `name` and `description`
fields of the [`PlaceTemplate`](#placetemplate) for the experience's start place.

### Product

      name: 100 Gold
      desription: Add 100 gold to your wallet!
      icon: products/100-gold.png
```

Because Roblox does not offer any way to delete developer products, when a product is "deleted" by
Rocat, it is updated in the following ways:

1. Its description is updated to: `Name: <name>\nDescription:\n<description>`
2. Its name is updated to `zzz_Deprecated(<date-time>)` where `<date-time>` is the current date-time
   in `YYYY-MM-DD hh::mm::ss.ns` format.

### Pass

A pass contains the fields:

- `name`: The display name of the game pass on the Roblox website and in-game.

    tipJar:
      name: Tip Jar
      desription: Drop some change to support the developers!
      icon: passes/tip-jar.png
```

Because Roblox does not offer any way to delete game passes, when a pass is "deleted" by
Rocat, it is updated in the following ways:

1. Its description is updated to: `Name: <name>\nPrice: <price>\nDescription:\n<description>`
2. Its name is updated to `zzz_Deprecated(<date-time>)` where `<date-time>` is the current date-time

### Badge

A badge contains the fields:

      name: Capture First Ship!
      desription: You captured your first enemy ship!
      icon: badges/capture-first-ship.png
```

Because Roblox does not offer any way to delete badges, when a badge is "deleted" by

3. Its name is updated to `zzz_Deprecated(<date-time>)` where `<date-time>` is the current date-time
   in `YYYY-MM-DD hh::mm::ss.ns` format.

:::caution
By default, Rocat does not have permission to make purchases with Robux. Since creating badges costs
Robux, you will need to pass `--allow-purchases` flag when you want to create them.
:::

### Asset

An asset is either a string or an object containing the fields:

- `file`: The file path of the asset (no glob support).
  - **Required**
- `name`: The name of the
  [`rbxgameasset`](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Content#rbxgameasset).
  - **Required**

```yml title="Example"
templates:
  assets:
    - assets/*
    - file: marketing/icon.png
      name: game-thumbnail
```

If the asset is a string, it will be interpreted as a glob (e.g. `assets/*`) and the `rbxgameasset`
name of each matched file will be its file name without the extension. For example,
`assets/pirate-flag.png` will be given the `rbxgameasset` name `pirate-flag`.

Each file will be uploaded as the asset type matching its file extension. Supported file extensions
and their asset types:

| Asset type | File extensions                                 |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Image      | `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tga` |
| Audio      | `.ogg`, `.mp3`                                  |

:::caution
By default, Rocat does not have permission to make purchases with Robux. Since creating and updating
audio assets costs Robux, you will need to pass `--allow-purchases` flag when you want to create or
update them.
