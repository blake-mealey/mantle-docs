title: Configuration
---

By default, Mantle looks for a project's configuration in a `mantle.yml` file but you can optionally
point Mantle to any YAML file.

## Reference

The configuration file contains the fields:

- `owner`: The owner of the resources that will be created. An [`Owner`](#owner). Defaults to
  `"personal"`.
- `payments`: Where Robux should come from to purchase resources (if `--allow-purchases` is
  enabled). A [`Payments`](#payments). Defaults to `"owner"`.
- `environments`: An array of [`Environment`](#environment) objects.
  - **Required**
- `target`: A [`Target`](#target) object.
  - **Required**
- `state`: A [`State`](#state). Defaults to `"local"`.

### Owner

An owner is either `"personal"` or an object with the fields:

- `group`: A group ID.
  - **Required**

```yml title="Group Example"
owner:
  group: 5723117
```

```yml title="Personal Example (Default)"
owner: personal
```

When set to `"personal"`, all resources will be created under the authenticated user. When set to a
group, all resources will be created under that group.

### Payments

A payments is either `"owner"`, `"personal"`, or `"group"`.

```yml title="Personal Example"
payments: personal
```

```yml title="Group Example"
payments: group
```

```yml title="Owner Example (Default)"
payments: owner
```

When set to `"owner"`, payments will come from the balance of the owner specified by the
[top-level](#reference) `owner` field. When set to `"personal"`, all purchases will be made from the
authenticated user's balance. When set to `"group"`, all purchases will be made from group funds.
Payments can only be set to `"group"` when `"owner"` is also set to a group, since Roblox does not
allow groups to pay for purchases of resources outside of themselves.

### Environment

A environment contains the fields:

- `name`: The name of the environment. Must be unique across all environments.
  - **Required**
- `branches`: An array of file globs to match against Git branches. If the `--environment` option is
  not specified, this is how Mantle determines which environment to use.
- `tagCommit`: A boolean indicating whether or not to tag the commit with place file versions after
  successful deployments. It is recommended to only enable this on production environment
  configurations.
- `overrides`: An object containing overrides to the [top-level](#reference) `target` configuration.
  The type of this object depends on the type of target. For experience targets, this is an
  [`Experience`](#experience) object.

```yml title="Example"
environments:
  - name: staging
    branches: [dev, dev/*]
    overrides:
      places:
        start:
          configuration:
            name: Staging
  - name: production
    branches: [main]
    overrides:
      configuration:
        playability: public
```

### Target

A target contains _one_ of the fields:

- `experience`: An [`Experience`](#experience) object

```yml title="Example"
target:
  experience: {}

In the future, Mantle will support other target types like Plugins and Models.

### Experience

An experience contains the fields:

- `configuration`: An [`ExperienceConfiguration`](#experienceconfiguration) object.
- `places`: A dictionary of place names to [`Place`](#place) objects. There must be
  at least one place supplied with the name `"start"`, which will be used as the start place for the
  experience.

- `products`: A dictionary of product names to [`Product`](#product) objects.
- `passes`: A dictionary of pass names to [`Pass`](#pass) objects.

        icon: products/100-gold.png
        price: 45
```

Because Roblox does not offer any way to delete developer products, when a product is "deleted" by
Mantle, it is updated in the following ways:

1. Its description is updated to: `Name: <name>\nDescription:\n<description>`
2. Its name is updated to `zzz_Deprecated(<date-time>)` where `<date-time>` is the current date-time
   in `YYYY-MM-DD hh::mm::ss.ns` format.

### Pass

A pass contains the fields:

- `name`: The display name of the game pass on the Roblox website and in-game.

        icon: passes/ship-of-the-line.png
        price: 499
```

Because Roblox does not offer any way to delete game passes, when a pass is "deleted" by
Mantle, it is updated in the following ways:

1. Its description is updated to: `Name: <name>\nPrice: <price>\nDescription:\n<description>`
2. Its name is updated to `zzz_Deprecated(<date-time>)` where `<date-time>` is the current date-time
   in `YYYY-MM-DD hh::mm::ss.ns` format.

        icon: badges/capture-first-ship.png
```

:::caution
By default, Mantle does not have permission to make purchases with Robux. Since creating badges
costs Robux, you will need to use the `--allow-purchases` flag when you want to create them.
:::

Because Roblox does not offer any way to delete badges, when a badge is "deleted" by
Mantle, it is updated in the following ways:

1. It is disabled
2. Its description is updated to: `Name: <name>\nEnabled: <enabled>\nDescription:\n<description>`
3. Its name is updated to `zzz_Deprecated(<date-time>)` where `<date-time>` is the current date-time
   in `YYYY-MM-DD hh::mm::ss.ns` format.

### Asset

An asset is either a string or an object containing the fields:

- `file`: The file path of the asset (no glob support).
  - **Required**
- `name`: The name of the
  [`rbxgameasset`](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Content#rbxgameasset).
  - **Required**

```yml title="Example"
target:
  experience:
    assets:
      - assets/*
      - file: marketing/icon.png
        name: game-icon
```

:::caution
By default, Mantle does not have permission to make purchases with Robux. Since creating and
updating audio assets costs Robux, you will need to use the `--allow-purchases` flag when you want
to create or update them.
:::

If the asset is a string, it will be interpreted as a glob (e.g. `assets/*`) and the `rbxgameasset`
name of each matched file will be its file name without the extension. For example,
`assets/pirate-flag.png` will be given the `rbxgameasset` name `pirate-flag`.

Each file will be uploaded as the asset type matching its file extension. Supported asset types and
their file extensions:

| Asset type | File extensions                                 |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Image      | `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tga` |
| Audio      | `.ogg`, `.mp3`                                  |

### State

A state is either `"local"` or an object with the fields:

- `remote`: A [`RemoteState`](#remotestate) object.
  - **Required**

```yml title="Remote State Example"

    bucket: mantle-states
    key: pirate-wars
```

```yml title="Local State Example (Default)"
state: local
```

### RemoteState

A remote state contains the fields:

- `region`: A tuple of `[<name>, <endpoint>]` defining an AWS region. Note that `<endpoint>` is
  optional and only required if the region you wish to use is not a supported option. For valid
  `<name>` options, see [this
  list](https://rusoto.github.io/rusoto/rusoto_core/region/enum.Region.html#variants) converted to
  `kebab-case` (for example `us-west-2`).
  - **Required**
- `bucket`: The name of an AWS S3 bucket.
  - **Required**
- `key`: The key to use to store your state file. Note that it will be automatically postfixed with
  `".mantle-state.yml"`.
  - **Required**
