# Getting Started

## Authentication

Before you can get started with Rocat, you need to get the necessary authentication pieces. Please
remember never to store secrets in your version control systems as malicious actors could use them
to harm you if they got access.

Rocat uses different authentication pieces for different functionality:

- Place file deployment: Roblox API keys, which can be created in the [Roblox Creator
  portal](https://create.roblox.com/credentials) and can be given to Rocat via the `ROBLOX_API_KEY`
  environment variable.
- All other deployment operations: `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie, which can be copied from the dev tools on
  roblox.com and can be given to Rocat via the `ROBLOSECURITY` environment variable.
- Remote state file management: AWS credentials, which can be given to Rocat via any of the methods
  supported by
  [rusoto](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto/blob/master/AWS-CREDENTIALS.md#credentials). The
  simplest option is to provide the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

For more information, refer to the [Authentication guide](/docs/authentication).

for more information.
