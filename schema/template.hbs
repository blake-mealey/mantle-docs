## Config file resolving

All Mantle commands accept a `PROJECT` argument which tells Mantle where to look for your config file.
Mantle uses the following rules to find your config file:

1. If the `PROJECT` argument was _not provided_, use the `mantle.yml` file in the current directory as the
   config file (if it exists).
2. If the `PROJECT` argument was _a directory_, use the `mantle.yml` file in that directory as
   the config file (if it exists).
3. If the `PROJECT` argument was _a file_, use it as the config file (if it exists).

If no config file is found, Mantle will exit with an error code.

## YAML syntax

Mantle config files use YAML syntax, and should have either a `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension. To
quickly get started with the YAML syntax, see "[Learn YAML in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)"
or read through the examples in this guide and in the [Examples](https://github.com/blake-mealey/mantle-examples)
repo.
